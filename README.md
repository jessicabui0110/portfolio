### Customers Segmentation
**Description:** The goal is to identify key customer segments to allow for more targeted marketing and product development. This project performs customer segmentation on mall customer data to identify the key shopping groups based on income, age, and mall shopping score. <br>

**Business Problem:**

The marketing team wants to identify the most important customer segments to better target marketing activities. The boss has requested an ideal number of segments labeled with a name for each one.

**Technology Used:**
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib.pyplot
  - Numpy
  - Sklearn.cluster KMeans

**Code:** <a href = "https://github.com/jessicabui0110/Customer-Segmentation.git">

## Academic Projects
### Capstone Project: Land Use / Land Cover classification of satellite imagery without much labelled data - Python

**Description:** The project involves a software pipeline that leverages advanced machine learning techniques for pixel-level classification
(image segmentation) of land use and land cover in satellite imagery with minimal labelled data. This project aims to monitor ecological changes, such as forest clearing, mine site rehabilitation, and vegetation extent changes
over time. <br>

**Technology Used:**
- **Language**: Python
- **Tool**:  
  - Microsoft Planetary Computer
  - QGIS
- **Libraries**:
  - Rasterio
  - PyQt5
  - Matplotlib.pyplot
  - Numpy
  - Leaflet
